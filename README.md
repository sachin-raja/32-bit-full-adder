# 32-bit-Full-Adder

An adder is a combinational logic component that produces an arithmetic sum of two numbers. The adder consists of an adder bit and a carry bit. The carry bit can be implemented by the AND gate. The addition bit needs to be implemented by the OR gate of the OR gate and the NAND gate (which needs to be connected to the gate to connect the two logic gates). Connect the addition bit and the carry bit to achieve the addition bit output and the carry bit output. These are the most used among the complex operators out there as it is one among the basic operations needed for many applications.


Using a digital circuit an adder performs addition of binary numbers, so they are used in the arithmetic logic units or ALU in many computers. They used to address calculations, increment and decrement operators, table indices, etc and many more. They are classified into two Half Adder and Full Adder. The half adder adds two 1-bit numbers that generates two outputs, sum and carry. The carry is an overflow bit that is given into next MSB of a n-bit addition. The half-adder design and truth table are provided below, which uses a XOR gate for the Sum and an AND gate for Carry.
